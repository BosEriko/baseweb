# Get the Base Library

The first thing you'll have to do is to head over the Uber Figma Community and create a clone of the Base Library.

<Button $as="a" href="https://www.figma.com/@uber" target="_blank">
  Go to Figma Community
</Button>

Once there, click on the "Base Gallery", and hit "Duplicate" so you can get your copy of the Base Figma Library. As the library is rather big, this may take a while.

# About Figma Communities

Figma Community enables design teams to share their work, and others to re-use them. You can learn more about it in the [official announcement](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/).
